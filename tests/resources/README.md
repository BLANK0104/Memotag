# Test Resources

Place test files in this directory to be used in automated tests.

## Required Test Files

- `test_audio.wav`: A sample audio file for testing the audio processing endpoint
- `test_audio_invalid.txt`: An invalid file type for testing error handling

For privacy reasons, test audio files are not committed to the repository.
You should create your own test files or use a CI/CD system that provides these files.
