You're working on MemoTag's speech intelligence module. Your task is to process
5–10 anonymized voice clips (Find simulated/realistic samples) and extract patterns
that might indicate early cognitive impairment.
You will:
1. Preprocess audio and convert to text (if applicable).
2. Extract relevant features like:
○ Pauses per sentence
○ Hesitation markers (uh, um, etc.)
○ Word recall issues (e.g., word substitution)
○ Speech rate, pitch variability
○ Naming & Word-Association Tasks (lost words)
○ Sentence Completion
3. Apply a basic unsupervised ML/NLP approach (e.g., clustering, similarity
scoring, or anomaly detection) to find abnormal samples or patients at risk.
4. Share a short report explaining:
○ Which features were most insightful
○ What ML methods were used and why
○ Potential next steps to make it clinically robust
