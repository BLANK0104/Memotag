## Executive Summary

This report presents an analysis of speech patterns to detect potential signs of cognitive impairment.

- **Total samples analyzed:** 10
- **High-risk samples identified:** 2
- **Number of clusters found:** 3
- **Top predictive features:** counting_errors, pause_rate, word_finding_difficulty_count

## Feature Analysis

The following features were most predictive of cognitive impairment:

- **counting_errors** (Importance: 1.000): Errors in sequential tasks can indicate working memory issues.
- **pause_rate** (Importance: 0.873): Higher pause rates may indicate cognitive processing delays.
- **word_finding_difficulty_count** (Importance: 0.708): Direct indicator of word-finding problems common in early impairment.
- **pause_count** (Importance: 0.655): 
- **hesitation_ratio** (Importance: 0.653): The ratio of hesitations to total words indicates word retrieval difficulties.

## Cluster Analysis

Samples were grouped into clusters with these characteristics:

- **Cluster 0**: 8 samples, Average risk score: 0.116, Predominant impairment: none
- **Cluster 2**: 1 samples, Average risk score: 0.704, Predominant impairment: moderate
- **Cluster 1**: 1 samples, Average risk score: 1.000, Predominant impairment: severe

## High-Risk Samples

The following samples show the highest risk of cognitive impairment:

| Sample ID | Risk Score | Key Indicators |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| sample_07 | 1.000 | High hesitation, Frequent pauses, Word-finding issues |
| sample_06 | 0.704 | High hesitation, Frequent pauses, Word-finding issues |

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Based on the analysis of speech patterns, we can draw the following conclusions:

1. Hesitation markers and pauses are strong indicators of potential cognitive issues
2. Word-finding difficulties appear frequently in high-risk samples
3. Speech rate shows significant variation between normal and impaired samples

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Clinical Validation**: Validate these findings with clinical assessment data
2. **Expanded Features**: Include more acoustic features like pitch variation and articulation rate
3. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Track changes in these metrics over time for each individual
4. **Personalized Baselines**: Develop individualized baselines to account for natural speaking differences
5. **Multimodal Integration**: Combine speech analysis with other cognitive assessments for a more robust screening tool
